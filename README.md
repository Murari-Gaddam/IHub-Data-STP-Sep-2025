ðŸš€ iHub-Data AIML Training Program (Sep Batch)
This repository is a collection of my work during the iHub-Data Student Training Program on Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. It includes:

ðŸ§  Concept Notes â€“ distilled theory & key insights

ðŸ’» Colab Notebooks â€“ hands-on experiments & implementations

ðŸ“‚ Assignments & Projects â€“ structured problem-solving and applied ML

Iâ€™m using this repo as a learning log + knowledge base, documenting my growth in AI/ML while building a foundation for future research and real-world applications.
